# System Metric Assessor

This Python script analyzes and visualizes system performance metrics including CPU usage, memory utilization, and disk I/O using Python's `psutil` and `matplotlib` libraries.

## Installation

1. **Python Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Dependencies**: Use `pip` to install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil matplotlib
# Usage
Run the Script: Execute the script system_performance_analyzer.py using your preferred method, either in your terminal or an IDE.
  python system_performance_analyzer.py
# Functionality
The script uses psutil to collect system metrics and matplotlib to visualize them in different graphs:

CPU Usage: Tracks the percentage of CPU usage over time.

Memory Utilization: Monitors the percentage of memory (RAM) being utilized.

Disk I/O: Measures the read and write bytes of disk I/O operations.
 # Code Breakdown
The script contains a SystemPerformanceAnalyzer class with the following methods:

__init__(): Initializes empty lists to store CPU usage, memory utilization, disk I/O read, and disk I/O write data.
collect_metrics(): Gathers CPU usage, memory utilization, and disk I/O information using psutil and appends it to the respective lists.
visualize_metrics(): Uses matplotlib to plot the collected metrics in subplots for CPU usage, memory utilization, and disk I/O.
# Example Usage
The script provides an example of how to collect system metrics for 50 seconds, with a 1-second delay between each measurement, and visualize the gathered data.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    analyzer = SystemPerformanceAnalyzer()

    # Collect metrics for a certain duration
    for _ in range(50):
        analyzer.collect_metrics()
        time.sleep(1)  # Wait for 1 second between each measurement

    # Visualize collected metrics
    analyzer.visualize_metrics()
# Note:

Modify the duration or frequency of data collection by changing the loop parameters in the example usage section.
Ensure appropriate permissions to access system information.
Customize visualizations or add more metrics as needed.
For further details, refer to the comments in the script itself and consult the psutil and matplotlib documentation for more functionalities and options.

This detailed README.md file explains the installation process, script functionalities, code breakdown, usage instructions, and notes for customization, allowing users to understand, install, and utilize the script effectively.
